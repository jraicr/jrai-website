Back in 2009, I started progamming missions and tools for ArmA 2 players and developers. Since then, I have worked on various companies and projects of my own. I had the privilege of managing systems and developing solutions for a <a href="https://pycseca.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferer" rel="noopener">security company</a>, creating my own <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/15679" target="_blank" rel="noreferer" rel="noopener">commercial solutions for Unity</a>, and working at a <a href="https://www.cta-observatory.org/about/locations/ctao-north/" target="_blank" rel="noreferer" rel="noopener">huge scientific corporation</a>.

My main goal is to develop web applications and tools for clients and businesses. In my free time, I work on developing the commercial version of <a href="https://4frames.jrai.dev" target="_blank">4 Frames</a>, a challenging web game where you have to guess a movie through up to 4 frames.

When I'm not at the computer, I'm at the beach, watching some series with my wife, or plotting against <span class="ganon-word">Ganondorf</span>.
